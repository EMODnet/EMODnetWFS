The goal of EMODnetWFS is to allow interrogation of and access to EMODnet geographic vector data in R though the [EMODnet Web Feature Services](https://www.emodnet.eu/en/data). [Web Feature services (WFS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs) represent a change in the way geographic information is created, modified and exchanged on the Internet and offer direct fine-grained access to geographic information at the feature and feature property level. This package was developed by the Sheffield University during the EMODnet Biology WP4 data products workshop in June 2020.

You can read the product story on the EMODnet-Biology portal following [this link](https://www.emodnet-biology.eu/blog/emodnetwfs-access-emodnet-web-feature-service-data-through-r), or read the vignette directly in R after installing the package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("emodnetwfs")
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of EMODnetWFS from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("EMODnet/EMODnetWFS")
```
## Available services

All available services are contained in the `emodnet_wfs` package dataset.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(EMODnetWFS)
knitr::kable(emodnet_wfs)
```

To explore available services in Rstudio use:
```r
View(emodnet_wfs)
```

## Create Service Client

Create new WFS Client.  Specify the service using the `service` argument. 

```{r}

wfs_bath <- emodnet_init_wfs_client(service = "bathymetry")

wfs_bath$getUrl()
```

## Get WFS Layer info

You can get metadata about the layers available from a service. 

```{r}
emodnet_get_wfs_info(service = "bathymetry")
```

or you can pass a wfs client object.

```{r}
emodnet_get_wfs_info(wfs_bath)
```

You can also get info for specific layers from wfs object:

```{r}
wfs_cml <- emodnet_init_wfs_client("chemistry_marine_litter")
emodnet_get_wfs_info(wfs_cml)

layers <- c("bl_fishing_monitoring",
          "bl_beacheslocations_2001_2008_monitoring")

emodnet_get_layer_info(wfs = wfs_cml, layers = layers)
```


Finally, you can get details on all available services and layers from the server

```{r eval=FALSE}
emodnet_get_all_wfs_info()
```


## Get WFS layers

You can extract layers directly from a `wfs` object using layer names. All layers are downloaded as `sf` objects and output as a list with a named element for each layer requested.

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(wfs = wfs_cml, layers = layers)
```

You can change the output `crs` through argument `crs`.

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(wfs = wfs_cml, layers = layers, crs = 3857)

```


You can also extract layers directly from a WFS service.

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(service = "seabed_habitats_individual_habitat_map_and_model_datasets",
                   layers = c("dk003069", "dk003070"))

```


Layers can also be returned to a single `sf` object through argument `reduce_layers`.  If `TRUE` the function will try to reduce all layers into a single `sf`.

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(service = "seabed_habitats_individual_habitat_map_and_model_datasets",
                   layers = c("dk003069", "dk003070"), 
                   reduce_layers = TRUE)
```

If attempting to reduce fails, it will return a list with a warning:
 
```{r, error=TRUE}
emodnet_get_layers(wfs = wfs_cml, layers = layers,
                   reduce_layers = TRUE)
```

Using `reduce_layers = TRUE` is also useful for returning an `sf` object rather than a list in single layer request.

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(service = "seabed_habitats_individual_habitat_map_and_model_datasets",
                  layers = c("dk003069"), 
                   reduce_layers = TRUE)
```
